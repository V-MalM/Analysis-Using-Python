### Python-Challenge
#### Project Description --> This python project has two tasks:
### 1. PyBank 
* Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company from a set of financial data 'budget_data.csv' that is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.The script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
    * The total number of months included in the dataset
    * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
    * Analysis looks similar to the one below:

#### Resources
   * Folder PyBank : This folder contains two folders 
   		* 'Resources': Contains the financial data 'budget_data.csv'
   		* 'analysis' : Empty folder to which the output text file with analysis, will be written.
   * Python file 'main.py' that has python script for analyzing the financial data stored in 'Resources\budget_data.csv'


#### Sequence of execution
##### when main.py is executed

this happens


 
#### Execution:
  * The code is in the file main.py which can be located in the folder pyBank.
  * Using PyBank as the working folder, run main.py.
      * this happens
      * this happens
      * 
#### Results
   add images here

#### Important: Run main.py from pyBank as current working direcory
###### eRRORS !!!! What ERRORS ????
* Handled Filenotfound errors in case the script cannot find the source or destination folders/file
* Made sure ZeroDivisionError doent occur
* REST ASSURED, The code runs error free. Just Follow these detailed instructions ....
